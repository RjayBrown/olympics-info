<!-- CONCEPTS & GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

You can [make a contribution](#contributions) and build the next available feature on the roadmap or request a new feature [here](https://github.com/RjayBrown/olympics-search/issues/new). Any contributions you make are appreciated! You can also [fork the repo locally](https://github.com/RjayBrown/olympics-search#fork--run-locally) to use as a template for your own project. Making significant design or functional changes can be a great way to learn and get hands-on practice. Start with the node-intro.js file to review the core concepts below.

### Core Concepts

- Server-Side JavaScript with Node.js
- Asynchronous Programming
- Building API's (URL Endpoints & Serving Files)
- Public API's (Using Fetch & Handling JSON Data)

Working on this project helped me understand what servers are and how API's work. I learned how to create a server using the native node modules, and configure the API to respond with files that allow the website to be seen in the browser. Getting the data to display correctly when the page loads was a challenge, but going through that frustration definitely helped solidify my general knowledge of how JavaScript is used with the event loop to handle asynchronous operations in the browser and the server.

It's an amazing community space filled with supportive developers happy to answer any questions you may have!

## Fork & Run Locally

**1.** To get started, open this [link](https://github.com/RjayBrown/olympics-search/fork) in a new tab to fork this repository

- _**NOTE:** You may find it easier to keep the same name, but you can change it if you like!_

**2.** Click the code button to open the dropdown and copy the URL **(make sure HTTPS is selected)**.

**3.** Open the terminal in your editor, type 'git clone' and paste the URL **(the command should follow one of the formats below)**.

```
 git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/olympics-search
```

```
 git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME
```

**4.** Run the command **(Press Enter)**

**5.** Navigate to the project folder

```
cd olympics-search
```

```
cd YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME
```

**Done!** You are now able to make changes or completely rebuild the project. Happy coding!

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

## Contributions

Contributions are ultimately what makes the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. My goal for this project is to provide a useful resource for people to get hands-on coding practice and learn by doing!!! If you want to build a feature from the roadmap or have any ideas for a new feature, you can clone the repository **_(see step 1 below)_** and create a pull request. If you find a bug, you can open an issue [here](https://github.com/RjayBrown/olympics-search/issues/new). Thank you for contributing to the project!
